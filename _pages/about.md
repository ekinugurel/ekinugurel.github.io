## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [THINK](https://sites.uw.edu/thinklab/) lab at the University of Washington-Seattle, where I am advised by [Cynthia Chen](https://www.ce.washington.edu/facultyfinder/cynthia-chen). My work at the UW is supported by the [College of Engineering Dean's Fellowship](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/deans_scholarships#:~:text=field%20of%20study.-,To%20be%20eligible%20to%20apply%20for%20this%20fellowship%2C%20students%20must,coursework%20completed%20at%20the%20UW.). Before this, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, where I conducted research with [Christian Claudel](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/claudel). At UT, I was supported by a variety of scholarships including the [Endowed Presidential Scholarship](https://onestop.utexas.edu/scholarships/unrestricted-endowed-presidential-scholarship-ueps/), James F. and B. M. Hinton Scholarship, and the Canning Scholarship. 

My current research aims to innovate novel methods to model mobile data (i.e. GPS traces from mobile devices) for human mobility analysis. I am particularly interested in kernel-based techniques to uncover non-linear spatiotemporal relationships in high dimensions. I find mobile data a particularly powerful tool for the future, as it can give an approximation of human movements at various geographical scales. 

More broadly, I am interested in high-dimensional probability, generative techniques, and causality studies in the context of modern transportation problems. In the long-term, I aim to bridge traditional travel behavior frameworks with contemporary advances in machine learning, focusing on developing robust, scalable methods that can infer and predict complex mobility patterns.

You can reach me at the following email (CV available upon request).
